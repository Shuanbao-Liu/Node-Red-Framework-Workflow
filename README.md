This is a program based on IBM IOT platform Node-Red framwork.  

We could use Node-Red workflow collect the data from the devices(eg.sensors,industrial Equipments,Embeded devices) to the Cloud platform such as Siemens MindSphere or AliCloud.  

The Node-Red workflow creates a bridge between the bottom layer and Cloud platform.
